# OpenSalon: The Open-Source Salonist & Fresha Alternative

[![Deploy with Clawnify](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy-button.svg)](https://app.clawnify.com/deploy?repo=clawnify/OpenSalon)

An appointment booking and business management app for salons, spas, barbershops, tattoo studios, and any appointment-based business. Part of the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem. Zero cloud dependencies — runs locally with SQLite.

Built with **Preact + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui + Hono + SQLite**. Ships with a day calendar with staff columns, appointment scheduling, client database, service catalog, product inventory, and blocked time slots.

## What Is It?

OpenSalon is a production-ready appointment scheduling platform designed for the OpenClaw community. Think of it as an open-source alternative to **Salonist**, **Fresha**, **Square Appointments**, **Vagaro**, or **Booksy** — a complete booking and staff management system you can self-host, customize, and embed in any SaaS product.

Unlike Salonist or Fresha, this runs entirely on your own infrastructure. No per-user fees, no booking commissions, no vendor lock-in. Manage your entire appointment-based operation from scheduling to inventory.

## Built for Every Appointment-Based Business

OpenSalon is **vertical-agnostic** — configure services, pricing, and staff for any industry:

| Industry | Example Services |

| **Barbershops** | Haircut, beard trim, shave, lineup, hair coloring, kids cut |
| **Hair Salons** | Cut & style, blowout, balayage, highlights, keratin treatment, extensions |
| **Spas & Massage** | Swedish massage, deep tissue, hot stone, facial, body wrap, aromatherapy |

| **Lash & Brow Studios** | Lash extensions, lash lift, brow lamination, microblading, tinting |
| **Med Spas & Aesthetics** | Botox, fillers, chemical peel, laser treatment, microneedling, IV therapy |
| **Personal Trainers & Gyms** | PT session, group class, assessment, nutrition consult, recovery session |
| **Yoga & Pilates Studios** | Group class, private session, workshop, teacher training, meditation |
| **Physiotherapy & Chiropractic** | Initial assessment, follow-up, manual therapy, dry needling, rehab session |
| **Tutoring & Coaching** | 1-on-1 session, group session, assessment, exam prep, mentoring |

## Features

- **Day calendar view** — visual schedule with staff columns, colored appointment blocks, and day navigation (like Salonist/Square)
- **Appointment booking** — create bookings with client, staff, date/time, and multiple services; auto-calculates duration and total price
- **Rescheduling** — move an existing booking to a new date or time from its details, keeping its duration, services and history; staff conflicts require an explicit override
- **Blocked time slots** — mark breaks, lunch hours, or days off per staff member, with a warning before covering existing work
- **Client management** — full database with contact info, notes, preferences, and appointment history with services and latest visit notes at a glance
- **Staff management** — team directory with color coding, titles/roles, activate/deactivate, and appointment counts
- **Service catalog** — configurable services with duration, price, color, and category grouping
- **Product inventory** — track retail products with cost/price, stock levels, low stock alerts, brand, and SKU
- **Multi-service bookings** — select multiple services per appointment with automatic duration and price calculation
- **Status workflow** — booked → confirmed → in progress → completed (or cancelled/no show)
- **Activity notes** — timestamped notes on every appointment for internal communication
- **Dashboard** — at-a-glance KPIs: today's appointments, upcoming count, revenue, client count, low stock alerts
- **Search & filter** — find appointments by status, search clients by name/email/phone
- **URL routing** — bookmarkable pages (`/calendar`, `/appointments/123`, `/clients`, `/staff`, `/services`, `/products`)
- **Dual-mode UI** — human-optimized + AI-agent-optimized (`?agent`)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/OpenSalon.git
cd open-salon
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5174` in your browser. Data persists in `data.db`.

### Agent Mode (for OpenClaw / Claude Code)

Append `?agent` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5174/?agent
```

This activates an agent-friendly UI with:
- Explicit delete/action buttons always visible (no hover-to-reveal)
- Large click targets for reliable browser automation
- All controls accessible without drag interactions

### Using with Claude Code

Claude Code can interact with the salon through the REST API:

```bash
# Create a client
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Jane Smith", "phone": "555-0100", "email": "jane@example.com"}'

# Book an appointment with multiple services
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/appointments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id": 1, "staff_id": 1, "scheduled_date": "2025-01-15", "start_time": "10:00", "service_ids": [1, 2]}'

# Block a time slot for lunch
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/blocked-slots \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"staff_id": 1, "blocked_date": "2025-01-15", "start_time": "12:00", "end_time": "13:00", "reason": "Lunch"}'
```
